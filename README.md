# SkyLookup

SkyLookup is an directory-tree based indexed key-value database.

While it is limited to key-value pairs, it can handle more than a million rows in-browser.
SkyLookup stores the data in alphabetical order in multiple files, and even if you have a 1000 files (1 million rows), it will make only 2 ajax requests to find the result.
